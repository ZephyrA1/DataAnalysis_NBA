# Who is NBA Greatest Player of All Time?
The debate over who is the greatest basketball player of all time (GOAT) is absurd and often based on individual preferences. LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Michael Jordan are regarded as some of the best players in NBA history, and each has had a unique playing style and accomplished remarkable things in their careers.

Three great basketball players—Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James—have their regular-season and postseason basketball metrics carefully studied in the data set. A number of important factors are covered by the statistics, such as points per game, shooting percentages, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. With the purpose of emphasising each player's unique strengths and flaws this data tries to highlight the ways they individually contribute to the game. The graphic provides an in-depth assessment of these basketball superstars, highlighting their skill on the court in various game situations and seasons.
